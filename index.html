          <h1>Paris</h1>
          <p>
            Paris (French pronunciation: ​[paʁi] (About this soundlisten)) is
            the capital and most populous city of France, with an area of 105
            square kilometres (41 square miles) and an official estimated
            population of 2,140,526 residents as of 1 January 2019.[1] Since the
            17th century, Paris has been one of Europe's major centres of
            finance, diplomacy, commerce, fashion, science, and the arts. The
            City of Paris is the centre and seat of government of the
            Île-de-France, or Paris Region, which has an estimated official 2019
            population of 12,213,364, or about 18 percent of the population of
            France.[1] The Paris Region had a GDP of €709 billion ($808 billion)
            in 2017.[3] According to the Economist Intelligence Unit Worldwide
            Cost of Living Survey in 2018, Paris was the second most expensive
            city in the world, after Singapore, and ahead of Zürich, Hong Kong,
            Oslo and Geneva.[4] Another source ranked Paris as most expensive,
            on a par with Singapore and Hong Kong, in 2018.[5]
          </p>
          <p>
            The city is a major railway, highway, and air-transport hub served
            by two international airports: Paris-Charles de Gaulle (the second
            busiest airport in Europe) and Paris-Orly.[6][7] Opened in 1900, the
            city's subway system, the Paris Métro, serves 5.23 million
            passengers daily,[8] and is the second busiest metro system in
            Europe after Moscow Metro. Gare du Nord is the 24th busiest railway
            station in the world, but the first located outside Japan, with 262
            million passengers in 2015.[9]
          </p>
          <p>
            Paris is especially known for its museums and architectural
            landmarks: the Louvre was the most visited art museum in the world
            in 2018, with 10.2 million visitors.[10][11] The Musée d'Orsay,
            Musée Marmottan Monet, and Musée de l'Orangerie are noted for their
            collections of French Impressionist art, the Pompidou Centre Musée
            National d'Art Moderne has the largest collection of modern and
            contemporary art in Europe, and the Musée Rodin and Musée Picasso
            exhibit the works of the two noted Parisians. The historical
            district along the Seine in the city centre is classified as a
            UNESCO Heritage Site, and popular landmarks in the city centre
            include the Cathedral of Notre Dame de Paris and the Gothic royal
            chapel of Sainte-Chapelle, both on the Île de la Cité; the Eiffel
            Tower, constructed for the Paris Universal Exposition of 1889; the
            Grand Palais and Petit Palais, built for the Paris Universal
            Exposition of 1900; the Arc de Triomphe on the Champs-Élysées, and
            the Basilica of Sacré-Coeur on the hill of Montmartre.

            The name "Paris" is derived from its early inhabitants, the Celtic
            Parisii tribe.[14] The city's name is not related to the Paris of
            Greek mythology. Paris is often referred to as the City of Light (La
            Ville Lumière),[15] both because of its leading role during the Age
            of Enlightenment and more literally because Paris was one of the
            first large European cities to use gas street lighting on a grand
            scale on its boulevards and monuments. Gas lights were installed on
            the Place du Carousel, Rue de Rivoli and Place Vendome in 1829. By
            1857, the Grand boulevards were lit.[16] By the 1860s, the
            boulevards and streets of Paris were illuminated by 56,000 gas
            lamps.[17] Since the late 19th century, Paris has also been known as
            Panam(e) (pronounced [panam]) in French slang.[18] Inhabitants are
            known in English as "Parisians" and in French as Parisiens
            ([paʁizjɛ̃] (About this soundlisten)). They are also pejoratively
            called Parigots ([paʁiɡo] (About this soundlisten)).[note 1][19]
          </p>
          <p>
            By the end of the 12th century, Paris had become the political,
            economic, religious, and cultural capital of France.[29] The Palais
            de la Cité, the royal residence, was located at the western end of
            the Île de la Cité. In 1163, during the reign of Louis VII, Maurice
            de Sully, bishop of Paris, undertook the construction of the Notre
            Dame Cathedral at its eastern extremity. After the marshland between
            the river Seine and its slower 'dead arm' to its north was filled in
            around the 10th century,[30] Paris' cultural centre began to move to
            the Right Bank. In 1137, a new city marketplace (today's Les Halles)
            replaced the two smaller ones on the Île de la Cité and Place de la
            Grève (Hotel de Ville).[31] The latter location housed the
            headquarters of Paris' river trade corporation, an organisation that
            later became, unofficially (although formally in later years),
            Paris' first municipal government. In the late 12th century, Philip
            Augustus extended the Louvre fortress to defend the city against
            river invasions from the west, gave the city its first walls between
            1190 and 1215, rebuilt its bridges to either side of its central
            island, and paved its main thoroughfares.[32] In 1190, he
            transformed Paris' former cathedral school into a student-teacher
            corporation that would become the University of Paris and would draw
            students from all of Europe.[33][29] With 200,000 inhabitants in
            1328, Paris, then already the capital of France, was the most
            populous city of Europe. By comparison, London in 1300 had 80,000
            inhabitants.[34]
          </p>
          <p>
            During the Hundred Years' War, Paris was occupied by
            England-friendly Burgundian forces from 1418, before being occupied
            outright by the English when Henry V of England entered the French
            capital in 1420;[35] in spite of a 1429 effort by Joan of Arc to
            liberate the city,[36] it would remain under English occupation
            until 1436. In the late 16th-century French Wars of Religion, Paris
            was a stronghold of the Catholic League, the organisers of 24 August
            1572 St. Bartholomew's Day massacre in which thousands of French
            Protestants were killed.[37][38] The conflicts ended when pretender
            to the throne Henry IV, after converting to Catholicism to gain
            entry to the capital, entered the city in 1594 to claim the crown of
            France. This king made several improvements to the capital during
            his reign: he completed the construction of Paris' first uncovered,
            sidewalk-lined bridge, the Pont Neuf, built a Louvre extension
            connecting it to the Tuileries Palace, and created the first Paris
            residential square, the Place Royale, now Place des Vosges. In spite
            of Henry IV's efforts to improve city circulation, the narrowness of
            Paris' streets was a contributing factor in his assassination near
            Les Halles marketplace in 1610.[39] During the 17th century,
            Cardinal Richelieu, chief minister of Louis XIII, was determined to
            make Paris the most beautiful city in Europe. He built five new
            bridges, a new chapel for the College of Sorbonne, and a palace for
            himself, the Palais Cardinal, which he bequeathed to Louis XIII.
            After Richelieu's death in 1642, it was renamed the
            Palais-Royal.[40] Due to the Parisian uprisings during the Fronde
            civil war, Louis XIV moved his court to a new palace, Versailles, in
            1682. Although no longer the capital of France, arts and sciences in
            the city flourished with the Comédie-Française, the Academy of
            Painting, and the French Academy of Sciences. To demonstrate that
            the city was safe from attack, the king had the city walls
            demolished and replaced with tree-lined boulevards that would become
            the Grands Boulevards of today.[41] Other marks of his reign were
            the Collège des Quatre-Nations, the Place Vendôme, the Place des
            Victoires, and Les Invalides.[42]
          </p>
          <p>
            Paris grew in population from about 400,000 in 1640 to 650,000 in
            1780.[43] A new boulevard, the Champs-Élysées, extended the city
            west to Étoile,[44] while the working-class neighbourhood of the
            Faubourg Saint-Antoine on the eastern site of the city grew more and
            more crowded with poor migrant workers from other regions of
            France.[45] Paris was the centre of an explosion of philosophic and
            scientific activity known as the Age of Enlightenment. Diderot and
            d'Alembert published their Encyclopédie in 1751, and the Montgolfier
            Brothers launched the first manned flight in a hot-air balloon on 21
            November 1783, from the gardens of the Château de la Muette. Paris
            was the financial capital of continental Europe, the primary
            European centre of book publishing and fashion and the manufacture
            of fine furniture and luxury goods.[46] The storming of the Bastille
            on 14 July 1789, by Jean-Pierre Houël In the summer of 1789, Paris
            became the centre stage of the French Revolution. On 14 July, a mob
            seized the arsenal at the Invalides, acquiring thousands of guns,
            and stormed the Bastille, a symbol of royal authority. The first
            independent Paris Commune, or city council, met in the Hôtel de
            Ville and, on 15 July, elected a Mayor, the astronomer Jean Sylvain
            Bailly.[47]
          </p>
          <p>
            By 1901, the population of Paris had grown to 2,715,000.[56] At the
            beginning of the century, artists from around the world including:
            Pablo Picasso, Modigliani, and Henri Matisse made Paris their home.
            It was the birthplace of Fauvism, Cubism and abstract art,[57][58]
            and authors such as Marcel Proust were exploring new approaches to
            literature.[59] During the First World War, Paris sometimes found
            itself on the front line; 600 to 1,000 Paris taxis played a small
            but highly important symbolic role in transporting 6,000 soldiers to
            the front line at the First Battle of the Marne. The city was also
            bombed by Zeppelins and shelled by German long-range guns.[60] In
            the years after the war, known as Les Années Folles, Paris continued
            to be a mecca for writers, musicians and artists from around the
            world, including Ernest Hemingway, Igor Stravinsky, James Joyce,
            Josephine Baker, Sidney Bechet[61] Allen Ginsberg[62] and the
            surrealist Salvador Dalí.[63] In the years after the peace
            conference, the city was also home to growing numbers of students
            and activists from French colonies and other Asian and African
            countries, who later became leaders of their countries, such as Ho
            Chi Minh, Zhou Enlai and Léopold Sédar Senghor.[64]
          </p>
          <p>
            On 14 June 1940, the German army marched into Paris, which had been
            declared an "open city".[65] On 16–17 July 1942, following German
            orders, the French police and gendarmes arrested 12,884 Jews,
            including 4,115 children, and confined them during five days at the
            Vel d'Hiv (Vélodrome d'Hiver), from which they were transported by
            train to the extermination camp at Auschwitz. None of the children
            came back.[66][67] On 25 August 1944, the city was liberated by the
            French 2nd Armoured Division and the 4th Infantry Division of the
            United States Army. General Charles de Gaulle led a huge and
            emotional crowd down the Champs Élysées towards Notre Dame de Paris,
            and made a rousing speech from the Hôtel de Ville.[68] In the 1950s
            and the 1960s, Paris became one front of the Algerian War for
            independence; in August 1961, the pro-independence FLN targeted and
            killed 11 Paris policemen, leading to the imposition of a curfew on
            Muslims of Algeria (who, at that time, were French citizens). On 17
            October 1961, an unauthorised but peaceful protest demonstration of
            Algerians against the curfew led to violent confrontations between
            the police and demonstrators, in which at least 40 people were
            killed, including some thrown into the Seine. The anti-independence
            Organisation armée secrète (OAS), for their part, carried out a
            series of bombings in Paris throughout 1961 and 1962.[69][70] In May
            1968, protesting students occupied the Sorbonne and put up
            barricades in the Latin Quarter. Thousands of Parisian blue-collar
            workers joined the students, and the movement grew into a two-week
            general strike. Supporters of the government won the June elections
            by a large majority. The May 1968 events in France resulted in the
            break-up of the University of Paris into 13 independent
            campuses.[71] In 1975, the National Assembly changed the status of
            Paris to that of other French cities and, on 25 March 1977, Jacques
            Chirac became the first elected mayor of Paris since 1793.[72] The
            Tour Maine-Montparnasse, the tallest building in the city at 57
            storeys and 210 metres (689 feet) high, was built between 1969 and
            1973. It was highly controversial, and it remains the only building
            in the centre of the city over 32 storeys high.[73] The population
            of Paris dropped from 2,850,000 in 1954 to 2,152,000 in 1990, as
            middle-class families moved to the suburbs.[74] A suburban railway
            network, the RER (Réseau Express Régional), was built to complement
            the Métro, and the Périphérique expressway encircling the city, was
            completed in 1973.[75]

          <p>
            Chicago (/ʃɪˈkɑːɡoʊ/ (About this soundlisten), locally also
            /ʃɪˈkɔːɡoʊ/), officially the City of Chicago, is the most populous
            city in the U.S. state of Illinois and the third most populous city
            in the United States. With an estimated population of 2,705,994
            (2018), it is also the most populous city in the Midwestern United
            States. Chicago is the county seat of Cook County, the second most
            populous county in the US, with a small portion of the northwest
            side of the city extending into DuPage County near O'Hare Airport.
            Chicago is the principal city of the Chicago metropolitan area,
            often referred to as Chicagoland. At nearly 10 million people, the
            metropolitan area is the third most populous in the nation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Located on the shores of freshwater Lake Michigan, Chicago was
            incorporated as a city in 1837 near a portage between the Great
            Lakes and the Mississippi River watershed and grew rapidly in the
            mid-19th century.[7] After the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, which
            destroyed several square miles and left more than 100,000 homeless,
            the city made a concerted effort to rebuild.[8] The construction
            boom accelerated population growth throughout the following decades,
            and by 1900, less than 30 years after the great fire, Chicago was
            the fifth-largest city in the world.[9] Chicago made noted
            contributions to urban planning and zoning standards, including new
            construction styles (including the Chicago School of architecture),
            the development of the City Beautiful Movement, and the steel-framed
            skyscraper.[10][11]
          </p>
          <p>
            Chicago is an international hub for finance, culture, commerce,
            industry, education, technology, telecommunications, and
            transportation. It is the site of the creation of the first
            standardized futures contracts, issued by the Chicago Board of
            Trade, which today is the largest and most diverse derivatives
            market in the world, generating 20% of all volume in commodities and
            financial futures alone.[12] Depending on the particular year, the
            city's O'Hare International Airport is routinely ranked as the
            world's fifth or sixth busiest airport according to tracked data by
            the Airports Council International.[13] The region also has the
            largest number of federal highways and is the nation's railroad
            hub.[14] Chicago was listed as an alpha global city by the
            Globalization and World Cities Research Network,[15] and it ranked
            seventh in the entire world in the 2017 Global Cities Index.[16]

            Chicago's 58 million domestic and international visitors in 2018
            made it the second most visited city in the nation, as compared with
            New York City's 65 million visitors in 2018.[19][20] The city was
            ranked first in the 2018 Time Out City Life Index, a global quality
            of life survey of 15,000 people in 32 cities.[21][22][23][24][25]
            Landmarks in the city include Millennium Park, Navy Pier, the
            Magnificent Mile, the Art Institute of Chicago, Museum Campus, the
            Willis (Sears) Tower, Grant Park, the Museum of Science and
            Industry, and Lincoln Park Zoo. Chicago's culture includes the
            visual arts, literature, film, theatre, comedy (especially
            improvisational comedy), food, and music, particularly jazz, blues,
            soul, hip-hop, gospel,[26] and electronic dance music including
            house music. Of the area's many colleges and universities, the
            University of Chicago, Northwestern University, and the University
            of Illinois at Chicago are classified as "highest research" doctoral
            universities. Chicago has professional sports teams in each of the
            major professional leagues, including two Major League Baseball
            teams.

            In the mid-18th century, the area was inhabited by the Potawatomi, a
            Native American tribe who had succeeded the Miami and Sauk and Fox
            peoples in this region.[30] The first known non-indigenous permanent
            settler in Chicago was explorer Jean Baptiste Point du Sable. Du
            Sable was of African and French descent and arrived in the
            1780s.[31][32][33] He is commonly known as the "Founder of Chicago".
            In 1795, following the victory of the new United States in the
            Northwest Indian War, an area that was to be part of Chicago was
            turned over to the US for a military post by native tribes in
            accordance with the Treaty of Greenville. In 1803, the United States
            Army built Fort Dearborn. This was destroyed in 1812 in the Battle
            of Fort Dearborn by the British and their native allies. It was
            later rebuilt.[34] After the War of 1812, the Ottawa, Ojibwe, and
            Potawatomi tribes ceded additional land to the United States in the
            1816 Treaty of St. Louis. The Potawatomi were forcibly removed from
            their land after the Treaty of Chicago in 1833 and sent west of the
            Mississippi River during Indian Removal.[35][36][37]

            On August 12, 1833, the Town of Chicago was organized with a
            population of about 200.[37] Within seven years it grew to more than
            6,000 people. On June 15, 1835, the first public land sales began
            with Edmund Dick Taylor as U.S. Senator of Public Monies. The City
            of Chicago was incorporated on Saturday, March 4, 1837,[38] and for
            several decades was the world's fastest-growing city.[39] As the
            site of the Chicago Portage,[40] the city became an important
            transportation hub between the eastern and western United States.
            Chicago's first railway, Galena and Chicago Union Railroad, and the
            Illinois and Michigan Canal opened in 1848. The canal allowed
            steamboats and sailing ships on the Great Lakes to connect to the
            Mississippi River.[41][42][43][44] A flourishing economy brought
            residents from rural communities and immigrants from abroad.
            Manufacturing and retail and finance sectors became dominant,
            influencing the American economy.[45] The Chicago Board of Trade
            (established 1848) listed the first-ever standardized
            "exchange-traded" forward contracts, which were called futures
            contracts.[46]

            The city responded by tunneling two miles (3.2 km) out into Lake
            Michigan to newly built water cribs. In 1900, the problem of sewage
            contamination was largely resolved when the city completed a major
            engineering feat. It reversed the flow of the Chicago River so that
            the water flowed away from Lake Michigan rather than into it. This
            project began with the construction and improvement of the Illinois
            and Michigan Canal, and was completed with the Chicago Sanitary and
            Ship Canal that connects to the Illinois River, which flows into the
            Mississippi River.[49][50][51] In 1871, the Great Chicago Fire
            destroyed an area about 4 miles (6.4 km) long and 1-mile (1.6 km)
            wide, a large section of the city at the time.[52][53][54] Much of
            the city, including railroads and stockyards, survived intact,[55]
            and from the ruins of the previous wooden structures arose more
            modern constructions of steel and stone. These set a precedent for
            worldwide construction.[56][57] During its rebuilding period,
            Chicago constructed the world's first skyscraper in 1885, using
            steel-skeleton construction.[58][59] The city has grown
            significantly in size and population by incorporating many
            neighboring townships between 1851 and 1920, with the largest
            annexation happening in 1889, with five townships joining the city,
            including the Hyde Park Township, which now comprises most of the
            South Side of Chicago and the far southeast of Chicago, and the
            Jefferson Township, which now makes up most of Chicago's Northwest
            Side.[60] The desire to join the city was driven by municipal
            services that the city could provide its residents.

            Chicago's flourishing economy attracted huge numbers of new
            immigrants from Europe and migrants from the Eastern United States.
            Of the total population in 1900, more than 77% were either
            foreign-born or born in the United States of foreign parentage.
            Germans, Irish, Poles, Swedes and Czechs made up nearly two-thirds
            of the foreign-born population (by 1900, whites were 98.1% of the
            city's population).[61][62] Labor conflicts followed the industrial
            boom and the rapid expansion of the labor pool, including the
            Haymarket affair on May 4, 1886, and in 1894 the Pullman Strike.
            Anarchist and socialist groups played prominent roles in creating
            very large and highly organized labor actions. Concern for social
            problems among Chicago's immigrant poor led Jane Addams and Ellen
            Gates Starr to found Hull House in 1889.[63] Programs that were
            developed there became a model for the new field of social work.[64]
            During the 1870s and 1880s, Chicago attained national stature as the
            leader in the movement to improve public health. City, and later,
            state laws that upgraded standards for the medical profession and
            fought urban epidemics of cholera, smallpox, and yellow fever were
            both passed and enforced. These laws became templates for public
            health reform in other cities and states.[65] The city established
            many large, well-landscaped municipal parks, which also included
            public sanitation facilities. The chief advocate for improving
            public health in Chicago was Dr. John H. Rauch, M.D. Rauch
            established a plan for Chicago's park system in 1866. He created
            Lincoln Park by closing a cemetery filled with shallow graves, and
            in 1867, in response to an outbreak of cholera he helped establish a
            new Chicago Board of Health. Ten years later, he became the
            secretary and then the president of the first Illinois State Board
            of Health, which carried out most of its activities in Chicago.[66]

            During World War I and the 1920s there was a major expansion in
            industry. The availability of jobs attracted African Americans from
            the Southern United States. Between 1910 and 1930, the African
            American population of Chicago increased dramatically, from 44,103
            to 233,903.[74] This Great Migration had an immense cultural impact,
            called the Chicago Black Renaissance, part of the New Negro
            Movement, in art, literature, and music.[75] Continuing racial
            tensions and violence, such as the Chicago Race Riot of 1919, also
            occurred.[76] The ratification of the 18th amendment to the
            Constitution in 1919 made the production and sale (including
            exportation) of alcoholic beverages illegal in the United States.
            This ushered in the beginning of what is known as the Gangster Era,
            a time that roughly spans from 1919 until 1933 when Prohibition was
            repealed. The 1920s saw gangsters, including Al Capone, Dion
            O'Banion, Bugs Moran and Tony Accardo battle law enforcement and
            each other on the streets of Chicago during the Prohibition era.[77]
            Chicago was the location of the infamous St. Valentine's Day
            Massacre in 1929, when Al Capone sent men to gun down members of a
            rival gang, North Side, led by Bugs Moran.[78] Chicago was the first
            American city to have a homosexual-rights organization. The
            organization, formed in 1924, was called the Society for Human
            Rights. It produced the first American publication for homosexuals,
            Friendship and Freedom. Police and political pressure caused the
            organization to disband.[79] The Great Depression brought
            unprecedented suffering to Chicago, in no small part due to the
            city's heavy reliance on heavy industry. Notably, industrial areas
            on the south side and neighborhoods lining both branches of the
            Chicago River were devastated; by 1933 over 50% of industrial jobs
            in the city had been lost, and unemployment rates amongst blacks and
            Mexicans in the city were over 40%. The Republican political machine
            in Chicago was utterly destroyed by the economic crisis, and every
            mayor since 1931 has been a Democrat. From 1928 to 1933, the city
            witnessed a tax revolt, and the city was unable to meet payroll or
            provide relief efforts. Unemployed workers, relief recipients, and
            unpaid schoolteachers held huge demonstrations during the early
            years of the Great Depression. The fiscal crisis was resolved by
            1933, and at the same time, federal relief funding began to flow
            into Chicago and enabled the city to complete construction of Lake
            Shore Drive, landscape numerous parks, construct 30 new schools, and
            build a thoroughly modernized State Street Subway.[80] Chicago was
            also a hotbed of labor activism, with Unemployed Councils
            contributing heavily in the early depression to create solidarity
            for the poor and demand relief, these organizations were created by
            socialist and communist groups. By 1935 the Workers Alliance of
            America begun organizing the poor, workers, the unemployed. In the
            spring of 1937 Republic Steel Works witnessed the Memorial Day
            massacre of 1937 in the neighborhood of East Side.

          <p>
            The City of New York, usually referred to as either New York City
            (NYC) or simply New York (NY), is the most populous city in the
            United States. With an estimated 2018 population of 8,398,748
            distributed over a land area of about 302.6 square miles (784 km2),
            New York is also the most densely populated major city in the United
            States.[10] Located at the southern tip of the state of New York,
            the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, the
            largest metropolitan area in the world by urban landmass[11] and one
            of the world's most populous megacities,[12][13] with an estimated
            19,979,477 people in its 2018 Metropolitan Statistical Area and
            22,679,948 residents in its Combined Statistical Area.[3][4] A
            global power city,[14] New York City has been described as the
            cultural,[15][16][17][18][19] financial,[20][21] and media capital
            of the world,[22][23] and exerts a significant impact upon
            commerce,[21] entertainment, research, technology, education,
            politics, tourism, art, fashion, and sports. The city's fast
            pace[24][25][26] has inspired the term New York minute.[27] Home to
            the headquarters of the United Nations,[28] New York is an important
            center for international diplomacy.[29][30]
          </p>
          <p>
            Situated on one of the world's largest natural harbors,[31][32] New
            York City consists of five boroughs, each of which is a separate
            county of the State of New York.[33] The five boroughs – Brooklyn,
            Queens, Manhattan, The Bronx, and Staten Island – were consolidated
            into a single city in 1898.[34] The city and its metropolitan area
            constitute the premier gateway for legal immigration to the United
            States.[35] As many as 800 languages are spoken in New
            York,[36][37][38] making it the most linguistically diverse city in
            the world.[37][39][40] New York City is home to more than 3.2
            million residents born outside the United States,[41] the largest
            foreign-born population of any city in the world.[42] As of 2019,
            the New York metropolitan area is estimated to produce a gross
            metropolitan product (GMP) of US$1.9 trillion.[8] If greater New
            York City were a sovereign state, it would have the 12th highest GDP
            in the world.[43] New York is home to the highest number of
            billionaires of any city in the world.[44]

            New York City traces its origins to a trading post founded by
            colonists from the Dutch Republic in 1624 on Lower Manhattan; the
            post was named New Amsterdam in 1626.[45] The city and its
            surroundings came under English control in 1664[45] and were renamed
            New York after King Charles II of England granted the lands to his
            brother, the Duke of York.[46] New York was the capital of the
            United States from 1785 until 1790,[47] and has been the largest US
            city since 1790.[48] The Statue of Liberty greeted millions of
            immigrants as they came to the U.S. by ship in the late 19th and
            early 20th centuries[49] and is an international symbol of the U.S.
            and its ideals of liberty and peace.[50] In the 21st century, New
            York has emerged as a global node of creativity and
            entrepreneurship,[51] social tolerance,[52] and environmental
            sustainability,[53][54] and as a symbol of freedom and cultural
            diversity.[55] In 2019, New York was voted the greatest city in the
            world per a survey of over 30,000 people from 48 cities worldwide,
            citing its cultural diversity.[15]

            Many districts and landmarks in New York City are well known,
            including three of the world's ten most visited tourist attractions
            in 2013;[56] a record 62.8 million tourists visited in 2017.[57]
            Several sources have ranked New York the most photographed city in
            the world.[58][59] Times Square, iconic as the world's "heart"[60]
            and "crossroads",[61] is the brightly illuminated hub of the
            Broadway Theater District,[62] one of the world's busiest pedestrian
            intersections,[63][64] and a major center of the world's
            entertainment industry.[65] The names of many of the city's
            landmarks, skyscrapers,[66] and parks are known internationally.
            Manhattan's real estate market is among the most expensive in the
            world.[67][68] New York is home to the largest ethnic Chinese
            population outside of Asia,[69][70] with multiple distinct
            Chinatowns across the city.[71][72][73] Providing continuous 24/7
            service,[74] the New York City Subway is the largest single-operator
            rapid transit system worldwide, with 472 rail stations.[75][76][77]
            The city has over 120 colleges and universities, including Columbia
            University, New York University, and Rockefeller University, ranked
            among the top universities in the world.[78][79] Anchored by Wall
            Street in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan, New York has
            been called both the most economically powerful city and world's
            leading financial center,[21][80][81][82] and is home to the world's
            two largest stock exchanges by total market capitalization, the New
            York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ.[83][84]

            A permanent European presence in New Netherland began in 1624 –
            making New York the 12th oldest continuously occupied
            European-established settlement in the continental United States[97]
            – with the founding of a Dutch fur trading settlement on Governors
            Island. In 1625, construction was started on a citadel and Fort
            Amsterdam, later called Nieuw Amsterdam (New Amsterdam), on
            present-day Manhattan Island.[98][99] The colony of New Amsterdam
            was centered at the site which would eventually become Lower
            Manhattan. It extended from the lower tip of Manhattan to modern day
            Wall Street,where a 12-foot wooden stockade was built in 1653 to
            protect against Native American and British Raids.[100] In 1626, the
            Dutch colonial Director-General Peter Minuit, acting as charged by
            the Dutch West India Company, purchased the island of Manhattan from
            the Canarsie, a small Lenape band,[101] for "the value of 60
            guilders"[102] (about $900 in 2018).[103] A disproved legend claims
            that Manhattan was purchased for $24 worth of glass beads.[104][105]
            Following the purchase, New Amsterdam grew slowly.[106] To attract
            settlers, the Dutch instituted the patroon system in 1628, whereby
            wealthy Dutchmen (patroons, or patrons) who brought 50 colonists to
            New Netherland would be awarded swathes of land, along with local
            political autonomy and rights to participate in the lucrative fur
            trade. This program had little success.[107]

            The Stamp Act Congress met in New York in October 1765, as the Sons
            of Liberty, organized in the city, skirmished over the next ten
            years with British troops stationed there.[128] The Battle of Long
            Island, the largest battle of the American Revolutionary War, was
            fought in August 1776 within the modern-day borough of
            Brooklyn.[129] After the battle, in which the Americans were
            defeated, the British made the city their military and political
            base of operations in North America. The city was a haven for
            Loyalist refugees and escaped slaves who joined the British lines
            for freedom newly promised by the Crown for all fighters. As many as
            10,000 escaped slaves crowded into the city during the British
            occupation. When the British forces evacuated at the close of the
            war in 1783, they transported 3,000 freedmen for resettlement in
            Nova Scotia.[130] They resettled other freedmen in England and the
            Caribbean. The only attempt at a peaceful solution to the war took
            place at the Conference House on Staten Island between American
            delegates, including Benjamin Franklin, and British general Lord
            Howe on September 11, 1776. Shortly after the British occupation
            began, the Great Fire of New York occurred, a large conflagration on
            the West Side of Lower Manhattan, which destroyed about a quarter of
            the buildings in the city, including Trinity Church.[131] In 1785,
            the assembly of the Congress of the Confederation made New York City
            the national capital shortly after the war. New York was the last
            capital of the U.S. under the Articles of Confederation and the
            first capital under the Constitution of the United States. In 1789,
            the first President of the United States, George Washington, was
            inaugurated; the first United States Congress and the Supreme Court
            of the United States each assembled for the first time, and the
            United States Bill of Rights was drafted, all at Federal Hall on
            Wall Street.[132] By 1790, New York had surpassed Philadelphia to
            become the largest city in the United States, but by the end of that
            year, pursuant to the Residence Act, the national capital was moved
            to Philadelphia.[133][134]

            The Great Irish Famine brought a large influx of Irish immigrants,
            of whom over 200,000 were living in New York by 1860, upwards of a
            quarter of the city's population.[143] There was also extensive
            immigration from the German provinces, where revolutions had
            disrupted societies, and Germans comprised another 25% of New York's
            population by 1860.[144] Democratic Party candidates were
            consistently elected to local office, increasing the city's ties to
            the South and its dominant party. In 1861, Mayor Fernando Wood
            called upon the aldermen to declare independence from Albany and the
            United States after the South seceded, but his proposal was not
            acted on.[138] Anger at new military conscription laws during the
            American Civil War (1861–1865), which spared wealthier men who could
            afford to pay a $300 (equivalent to $6,105 in 2018) commutation fee
            to hire a substitute,[145] led to the Draft Riots of 1863, whose
            most visible participants were ethnic Irish working class.[138] The
            situation deteriorated into attacks on New York's elite, followed by
            attacks on Black New Yorkers and their property after fierce
            competition for a decade between Irish immigrants and black people
            for work. Rioters burned the Colored Orphan Asylum to the ground,
            with more than 200 children escaping harm due to efforts of the New
            York Police Department, which was mainly made up of Irish
            immigrants.[144] At least 120 people were killed.[146] Eleven Black
            men were lynched over five days, and the riots forced hundreds of
            Blacks to flee the city for Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and New Jersey.
            The black population in Manhattan fell below 10,000 by 1865, which
            it had last been in 1820. The white working class had established
            dominance.[144][146] Violence by longshoremen against Black men was
            especially fierce in the docks area.[144] It was one of the worst
            incidents of civil unrest in American history.[147]

                    <p>Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court) while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop. A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three.</p>

According to an ESSEC Business School study commissioned by the International Olympic Committee, 3x3 is the largest urban team sport in the world. This basketball game format is currently being promoted and structured by FIBA, the sport's governing body.[1] Its primary competition is an annual FIBA 3X3 World Tour,[2] comprising a series of Masters and one Final tournament, and awarding six-figure prize money in US dollars. </p>
